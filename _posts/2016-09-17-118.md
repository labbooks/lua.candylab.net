the answer to the origin of this strategy is unclear. [3]  There are 3 different theories of its history:

这个答案的最开始渊源并已经不很清楚了。关于这个，有三种不同的历史说法。

1.Marketers (such as RH Macy) of mid 1800s tried to ambush their competitors in highly price sensitive goods.

1800年代中叶市场人员（列如RH Macy公司）试图去伏击竞争对手的高价格紧俏货品，采用的一种手段。

2.Melville Stone of Chicago Daily News priced his paper at 1 cent. However, given that cents were not in common use then, he coaxed local shops into odd pricing so that his customers will have the pennies to spend on his paper.   

Melvile Stone给芝加哥新闻日报的定价是1美分，然而，鉴于美分并不常用，他诱使当地商店使用奇数价格的定价，迫使消费者就范，使用商店消费找回的零钱买他的报纸。

3.As Quora User suggested, it was a cash control mechanism due to the arrival of the cash register. 

像Quora用户建议的那样， 这是因收银机来临而起的一种现金控制机制。

Why do they continue to do odd pricing?

为什么他们继续用奇数定价？

Customers see odd numbers as correctly priced rather than whole numbers. They tend to think that a rational process is involved in the pricing and go with the pricing. On the other hand, with whole pricing, some customers perceive that they are being gouged.

1.消费者认为看到的奇数价格比整数价格更准确。（认为这种价格合理）他们更倾向于有合理定价过程的定价。另一方面，一些消费这可能认为整数定价隐含有一种欺骗。

Odd pricing also sends a psychological cue that the good is priced to the lowest possible.

2.奇数价格也发出一种心理暗示，可能这是最底的好价格了。

In the earlier days, competitors in commodity products tried to gain more market share by pricing a penny or two lower than their competitors.

3.在过于的时日，竞争对手为了或得更大的市场份额，总是比对手价格底那么一点。

Various researches indicate that customers are swayed more by the most significant first digits of a price tag and sometimes by the last digit. In one research done in 1997 they found that 90% of the prices end with either 9 or 5. However, as customers are subconsciously getting used to these odd prices, other companies like Wal-mart favor more of pricing ending with .98 to stay out of the crowd.

各种研究表明，消费者总是受到价格的第一个数字，有时是最后一个数字的影响。1997年一项研究他们发现，90%的定价都是9或是5结尾，消费者潜意识里习惯接受了这种奇数定价，而其他公司像沃尔马，钟爱以98定价结尾，而张显与众不同。
